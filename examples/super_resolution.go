	// The super-resolution challenge
	challenge := `Develop a state-of-the-art mathematical algorithm for single-shot image super-resolution and digital zoom that significantly outperforms current methods.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- NO AI, DNN, or LLM methods allowed
- Must be based on pure mathematical formulas and algorithms
- Should work on a single low-resolution image (no multiple frames)
- Must provide superior quality compared to bicubic interpolation, Lanczos, etc.
- Focus on mathematical foundations: interpolation theory, sampling theorems, harmonic analysis, optimization

Consider: Advanced interpolation, frequency domain methods, optimization-based reconstruction, and information-theoretic approaches.`
